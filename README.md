Disclaimer: Although I have passed all of the hidden tests for this homework assignment, I can't guarantee the logic of my code is 100% correct given I might have misread the write-up and the hidden test didn't test against my potential failure. However, since it serves as an example for the style guide, you should be focusing more on the style part.
